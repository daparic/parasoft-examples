The "Sensor" project is provided to demonstrate the C++test and MDK-ARM
tools integration. Project is targeted for MCBSTM32E Evaluation Board and
Simulator.

Example functionality:                                                  
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =            8.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =           72.00 MHz
   - HCLK    = SYSCLK  = 72.00 MHz
   - PCLK1   = HCLK/2  = 36.00 MHz
   - PCLK2   = HCLK    = 72.00 MHz
   - ADCLK   = PCLK2/6 = 12.00 MHz
   - SYSTICK = HCLK/8  =  9.00 MHz
 - Captures the value from a "Sensor". "Sensor" is a potentiometer
   connected to ACD.
 - color LCD display shows status message and a bar graph
   depending on values from the "Sensor"
 - AD value is output onto serial port USART2
   USART2 settings: 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit
 
The "Sensor" program is available in different targets:
  Simulator:      configured for software Simulator
  STM32 Flash:    runs from Internal Flash located on chip and is
                  configured for Trace
  C++test         configured for running Unit Tests or Application
                  monitoring with C++test.
